# Welcome​

<img src="https://github.com/g-sanner/grace-sanner-profile/blob/master/assets/images/GZGrad.JPG?raw=true" width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

My name is Grace Sanner, and I am a senior Computer Science major, set to graduate in May 2026.
My emphasis is Enterprise Software, which allows me to understand how the business end of the 
tech world operates. To further this understanding, I am also pursuing two minors -- Business Administration
and Business Innovation & Entrepreneurship.

I am an Honors student. I work part-time at my community's library and part-time on-campus, 
helping students learn more about the programming language Assembler, which is the first step above 
machine language.

### Background

I grew up in a small town in Northern Illinois, with a big family of 3 brothers and 2 sisters. During
high school, I took an AP Computer Science course with one other student. The typical response to that 
was that "girls don't last in the technology world". I took that as a personal challenge.

I transferred to NIU after receiving my Associate's of Science from Rock Valley Community College,
where I graduated with Honors.

Over the course of the last two summers, I have interned at the software company, Ticomix, where I 
was working with the .NET framework to create ERP websites for a variety of clients.

Now a senior, I hope to expand my experience with the technology world and remind everyone that 
you belong. We all do.
