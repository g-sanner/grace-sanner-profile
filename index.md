# Welcome​

My name is Grace Sanner, and I am an upcoming Computer Science graduate at Northern Illinois University!

I am an Honors student. I work part-time at my community's library and part-time on-campus, helping students learn
more about the programming language Assembler, the first step above machine language.

### Background

I transferred to NIU after receiving my Associate's of Science from Rock Valley Community College.
