I contributed to the pino-pretty repository, an extension of the pino logging library that formats
the logged errors into a sensical and aesthetic string of errors.

My non-code contribution to this repository was updating some of the documentation to accurately
represent what the function was actually doing.

I also made a substantial non-code contribution to a private repository for another class. 

The purposeof this repository is to build a new system that enables the sales force of a repair company 
to record their quotes via the Internet. The system will maintain a database of sales associates, 
handle the recording of sales quotes, establish and fulfill purchase orders.

Thanks to my knowledge from this class, I was able to create a Gantt chart within this private repository
that breaks down the tasks into a week by week basis, so we can keep on top of self-imposed deadlines
and not end up rushing our final project.

Pictured below is said Gantt chart:
